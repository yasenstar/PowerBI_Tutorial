# Part 0: Introduction

## 0.0 Preface

### What does Business Intelligence (BI) require?

#### Basic: querying data sources, reporting, caching data, and visualizing data

#### If you had to address your organization's needs, what would they do?

#### Would taking structured, unstructured, and semistructured data and making sense of it be part of your organizational requirements?

#### Perhaps developing robust business analytics outputs for executive consumption?

#### Is the mandate from the leadership the delivery of complex reports, visualizations, dashboards, and key performance indicators?

### Brief history of Power BI

#### Power BI was initially conceived as part of the SQL Server Reporting Team back in 2010.

#### Then, Power BI made its way into the Office 365 suite in September 2013 as an advanced analytics product.

#### Power BI was built around Microsoft Excel core add-ins: Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power View.

#### Along the way, Microsoft added a few artificial intelligence features, such as the Q&A Engine, enterprise-level data connectors, and security options via the Power BI Gateway.

#### The product became so popular with the enterprise business community that, in July of 2015, Power BI was separated from the Office family, becoming its own product line.

#### Finally, in late 2019, Power BI merged with other Microsoft products to form the Power Platform family, which consists of Power Apps (mobile), Power Automate (workflow), and Power BI (business intelligence)
